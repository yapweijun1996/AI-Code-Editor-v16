# Git Operations in Browser-Based Editor

## Current Status

The `run_terminal_command` and `get_file_history` tools have been removed to maintain the client-centric architecture of this browser-based code editor. This document outlines alternative approaches for git operations.

## Why Git Commands Were Removed

1. **Security**: Terminal command execution poses security risks
2. **Architecture**: Contradicts the browser-first, client-centric design philosophy
3. **Complexity**: Reduces backend dependencies and maintenance overhead
4. **Reliability**: Eliminates backend command execution failures

## Alternative Approaches for Git Operations

### 1. Browser-Based Git Libraries

For future implementation, consider these JavaScript libraries that work entirely in the browser:

- **[isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/)**: Full-featured git implementation in JavaScript
- **[js-git](https://github.com/creationix/js-git)**: Pure JavaScript git implementation
- **[GitgraphJS](https://gitgraphjs.com/)**: Git graph visualization

### 2. File System Access API Integration

The browser's File System Access API could be extended to:
- Read `.git` directory contents
- Parse git objects and refs
- Display commit history without shell commands

### 3. External Git Client Integration

Recommend users to:
- Use their preferred git GUI client (GitKraken, SourceTree, GitHub Desktop)
- Use terminal git commands outside the editor
- Integrate with VS Code's built-in git features

### 4. Web-Based Git Services

Integration with git hosting services:
- GitHub API for repository information
- GitLab API for project data
- Bitbucket API for repository details

## Recommended User Workflow

1. **File Editing**: Use the browser-based editor for all file operations
2. **Version Control**: Use external git tools for commits, branches, and history
3. **Collaboration**: Use web-based git platforms for pull requests and code review

## Future Considerations

If git functionality becomes essential, implement it using:
- Pure JavaScript git libraries
- Browser-based file system operations
- No backend terminal command execution

This maintains the security and simplicity of the client-centric architecture while providing git capabilities.
