# ADR-001: Major Refactoring Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The AI Code Editor codebase has grown organically to ~30 JavaScript modules with several architectural issues:

- **Tight Coupling**: Global `appState` object contains functions and shared state
- **Circular Dependencies**: Complex import chains between modules
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Single modules handling multiple concerns
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling, state management, and API patterns
- **Performance Issues**: Redundant DOM queries, inefficient event handling
- **Maintainability Concerns**: Monolithic functions, debug code in production

These issues are impacting development velocity, system reliability, and user experience.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive refactoring strategy over 4 phases:

1. **Phase 0**: Establish performance baselines and documentation infrastructure
2. **Phase 1**: Foundation refactoring (DI container, error handling, state management)
3. **Phase 2**: Service layer restructuring (LLM services, tool system, API management)
4. **Phase 3**: Performance optimization and UI component system
5. **Phase 4**: Testing infrastructure and quality gates

We will prioritize:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain functionality during transition
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track improvements against baseline metrics
- **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable changes with rollback capability
- **Documentation**: Living documentation updated with code changes

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Better performance (target: 40% improvement in tool execution)
- Reduced coupling (target: 60% reduction in module dependencies)
- Consistent error handling and user experience
- Better testability and debugging capabilities

**Negative:**
- Significant development time investment (7-11 days)
- Risk of introducing regressions during refactoring
- Learning curve for new architectural patterns
- Temporary complexity during transition period

**Neutral:**
- Code review overhead for architectural changes
- Need for team coordination and communication
- Documentation maintenance overhead

## Notes
- Performance profiling system implemented to track improvements
- Feature flags will be used for gradual rollout of major changes
- Automated testing will be implemented to prevent regressions
- Rollback procedures established for each phase
