# ADR-004: Performance Monitoring and Profiling

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application lacks comprehensive performance monitoring and profiling capabilities:

- **No Baseline Metrics**: Can't measure improvement without initial benchmarks
- **Limited Visibility**: No insight into slow operations or performance bottlenecks
- **No Regression Detection**: Performance issues could be introduced without detection
- **User Experience Impact**: Slow operations degrade user experience without warning
- **Memory Leaks**: No monitoring for memory usage patterns and potential leaks
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Hard to identify performance issues in production

We need a comprehensive performance monitoring system that provides:
- Baseline metric establishment and comparison
- Real-time performance tracking with alerting
- Memory usage monitoring and leak detection
- Long task monitoring for UI responsiveness
- Integration with refactoring efforts to validate improvements

## Decision
We will implement a PerformanceProfiler system with the following capabilities:

1. **Comprehensive Metrics Collection**:
   - Custom operation timing with start/end timer API
   - Browser Performance API integration (navigation, resource, paint events)
   - Memory usage tracking with leak detection
   - Long task monitoring for UI responsiveness

2. **Baseline and Comparison System**:
   - Establish baseline metrics for key operations
   - Compare current performance against baselines
   - Track performance improvements over time
   - Generate improvement/regression reports

3. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Performance observer integration
   - Automatic alerting for slow operations (>1s)
   - Memory leak warnings (>50MB increase)
   - Long task detection for UI blocking

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Average, min, max calculations for all metrics
   - Value history tracking (last 1000 measurements)
   - Performance trends analysis
   - Error correlation with performance impact

5. **Integration Points**:
   - DI Container automatic method wrapping
   - Error Handler performance impact tracking  
   - State Manager update timing
   - Tool Executor operation profiling

## Features
- **Automatic Initialization**: Sets up observers and monitoring on load
- **Baseline Establishment**: Creates initial performance benchmarks
- **Smart Sampling**: Configurable sample rates to reduce overhead
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports for external analysis
- **Low Overhead**: Designed to minimize impact on application performance
- **Browser Compatibility**: Falls back gracefully on unsupported browsers

## Usage Examples
```javascript
import { performanceProfiler } from './core/performance_profiler.js';

// Time operations
const timerId = performanceProfiler.startTimer('fileOperation');
await performOperation();
const duration = performanceProfiler.endTimer(timerId);

// Record custom metrics
performanceProfiler.recordMetric('ui', 'renderTime', renderDuration);

// Set baselines
performanceProfiler.setBaseline('toolExecution', {
  averageTime: 500,
  memoryUsage: 25000000
});

// Compare against baseline
const comparison = performanceProfiler.compareToBaseline('toolExecution');
console.log('Performance improvement:', comparison);

// Generate comprehensive report
const report = performanceProfiler.generateReport();
```

## Baseline Metrics (Target Improvements)
- **Tool Execution**: 40% faster average execution time
- **File Operations**: 30% reduction in file access time
- **UI Rendering**: Maintain 60fps (16.67ms per frame)
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB total application footprint
- **Startup Time**: <2 seconds to full functionality

## Alert Thresholds
- **Slow Operations**: >1000ms execution time
- **Memory Leaks**: >50MB memory increase without corresponding functionality
- **UI Blocking**: >16.67ms continuous execution (blocks 60fps)
- **Resource Loading**: >5 seconds for external resources

## Integration Strategy
1. **Automatic Wrapping**: DI container automatically wraps service methods
2. **Manual Instrumentation**: Critical paths instrumented with timers
3. **Observer Integration**: Browser performance observers for native events
4. **Error Correlation**: Link performance issues with error patterns

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: Make performance improvements based on real metrics
- **Regression Prevention**: Automatically detect performance degradation
- **User Experience**: Identify and fix operations that impact user experience
- **Debugging Capability**: Detailed performance data for troubleshooting
- **Validation**: Measure success of refactoring efforts objectively
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Catch performance issues before they impact users

**Negative:**
- **Runtime Overhead**: Small performance cost for monitoring (mitigated by sampling)
- **Memory Usage**: Storage of performance metrics and history
- **Complexity**: Additional system to maintain and understand
- **False Positives**: May alert on operations that are legitimately slow

**Neutral:**
- **Browser Dependency**: Some features only available in modern browsers
- **Configuration**: Requires tuning of thresholds and sample rates

## Implementation Details
- **Observer Pattern**: Uses PerformanceObserver API where available
- **Sampling Strategy**: Configurable sample rate (default 100% for development)
- **Memory Management**: Automatically limits stored history to prevent memory issues
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when monitoring features unavailable
- **Export Format**: JSON-compatible data structures for external analysis

## Validation Criteria
- **Baseline Establishment**: Initial metrics captured within 1 second of app load
- **Overhead Impact**: <2% performance overhead from monitoring itself
- **Alert Accuracy**: <5% false positive rate for performance alerts
- **Data Retention**: Maintain 1000 data points per metric without memory issues
- **Browser Compatibility**: Functional (with degraded features) on 95% of target browsers

## Notes
- The profiler automatically integrates with the DI container to monitor service performance
- Baseline comparisons help validate the success of refactoring efforts
- Memory monitoring helps identify potential memory leaks early
- The system is designed to be lightweight and not impact user experience
- Performance data can be exported for analysis with external tools
