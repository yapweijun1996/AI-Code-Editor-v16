# Task Management System

The AI Code Editor includes a comprehensive Task Management System that helps developers track and manage tasks effectively. This document explains the core functionality, implementation details, and usage guidelines.

## Overview

The Task Management System allows users to:

- Create and track tasks with different statuses
- Start focused work sessions on specific tasks
- Record time spent on each task
- View task history and statistics

## Key Components

### Task Manager

The Task Manager (`frontend/js/task_manager.js`) is the central component that handles:

- Task creation and storage
- Status tracking and updates
- Session management
- History and reporting

### Task Sessions

Task Sessions provide a way to track focused work periods on specific tasks:

- **Starting a Session**: Begin a timed work session for a specific task
- **Session Tracking**: Record start time, duration, and activity
- **Session History**: View past sessions for productivity analysis

## Implementation Details

### TaskTools Class

The `TaskTools` class in `task_manager.js` implements the core functionality:

```javascript
class TaskTools {
  constructor(taskManager) {
    this.taskManager = taskManager;
  }

  // Start a focused work session on a specific task
  startSession(taskId, description = "") {
    const task = this.taskManager.getTask(taskId);
    if (!task) {
      return { success: false, error: "Task not found" };
    }

    const session = {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      taskId,
      startTime: new Date().toISOString(),
      description,
    };

    task.status = "in_progress";
    task.sessions = task.sessions || [];
    task.sessions.push(session);
    
    this.taskManager.updateTask(task);
    return { success: true, session };
  }

  // Additional methods for task management...
}
```

### Tool Integration

The Task Session functionality is integrated with the AI's tool system in `tool_executor.js`:

```javascript
function _startTaskSession(taskId, description = "") {
  return TaskTools.startSession(taskId, description);
}

// Tool registration
toolRegistry.startTaskSession = _startTaskSession;

// Tool definition
{
  name: "start_task_session",
  description: "Start a focused work session on a specific task",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      taskId: {
        type: "string",
        description: "ID of the task to start session for"
      },
      description: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Optional description of the session"
      }
    },
    required: ["taskId"]
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Starting a Task Session

Tasks can have sessions started in several ways:

1. **Via AI Tool**: The AI assistant can start a session using the `start_task_session` tool
2. **Programmatically**: Developers can call `TaskTools.startSession(taskId, description)`
3. **UI Integration**: The application UI provides buttons to start sessions on tasks

### Viewing Task History

The system maintains a complete history of task sessions, allowing users to:

- Review time spent on each task
- Analyze productivity patterns
- Generate reports on work distribution

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the Task Management System include:

- Task dependencies and relationships
- Time estimation and tracking
- Task prioritization
- Integration with external project management tools
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
